# HaxePunk

A Haxe port of the [FlashPunk](http://useflashpunk.net) AS3 library. There are a few additions/differences from the original.

* Builds for Flash, Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, and Ouya
* Circle/Polygon masks
* Hardware acceleration for native targets
* Joystick and multi-touch input
* Texture atlases for native targets (supports TexturePacker xml)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/HaxePunk/HaxePunk.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/HaxePunk/HaxePunk)

## Release build

First, make sure you have [Haxe](http://haxe.org) 2.10 or higher. Then execute the following commands below to get started with your first HaxePunk project.

```bash
haxelib install HaxePunk
haxelib run HaxePunk setup
haxelib run HaxePunk new MyProject # creates a new project
```

## Development build

You need to have ant installed to build a development version of HaxePunk. Make sure you set a default program for swf files to view the debug output. You will also need a C++ compiler for native builds (Xcode, Visual Studio, g++).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HaxePunk/HaxePunk.git
ant
```

This will install a dev version of HaxePunk through haxelib, run unit tests, and build an example project for flash/neko/native. If you fix an issue, feel free to create a pull request.

Generating documentation is just as simple. Run the commands below to create a new set of docs with chxdoc. The first two commands are optional if you already have chxdoc installed.
The documentation will be located in doc/docs/, simply open doc/docs/index.html with your web browser to see the doc.

```bash
haxelib git chxdoc https://github.com/ibilon/chxdoc.git
haxelib run chxdoc install pathToYourHaxeFolder
ant doc
```
