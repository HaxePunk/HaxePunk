HaxePunk is a powerful cross-platform 2D game engine, based on the [FlashPunk](http://useflashpunk.net) AS3 library.

* Builds for HTML5 (WebGL), Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android
* Hardware acceleration and texture atlas support
* Gamepad and multi-touch input

## Release build

First, make sure you have [Haxe](http://haxe.org) 3.0 or higher, we recommend you to update to Haxe 3.2 if you haven't already. Then execute the following commands below to get started with your first HaxePunk project.
If you are using Haxe 2 the last version supporting it was [v2.3.0](https://github.com/HaxePunk/HaxePunk/releases/tag/v2.3.0) `haxelib install HaxePunk 2.3.0`.

```bash
haxelib install HaxePunk
haxelib run HaxePunk setup
haxelib run HaxePunk new MyProject # creates a new project
```

## Development build

You will need a C++ compiler for native builds (Xcode, Visual Studio, g++).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HaxePunk/HaxePunk.git
make
```

This will build documentation, run unit tests, and run the example project. If you fix an issue, feel free to create a pull request.

If you've cloned locally, you can set your local repo as a development directory accessible through Haxelib:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HaxePunk/HaxePunk.git
haxelib dev HaxePunk HaxePunk/
```

To disable the dev directory for HaxePunk simply run the command `haxelib dev HaxePunk`. Notice there is no third argument passed.

If you just want to install the latest dev version from Git, you can also do this with haxelib:

```bash
haxelib git HaxePunk https://github.com/HaxePunk/HaxePunk.git dev
```
